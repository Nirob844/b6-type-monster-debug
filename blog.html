            <h2>Difference Between Local Storage, Session Storage. </h2>
            <p>
                localStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs (meaning, not all legacy browsers will support
                them) and are near identical (both in APIs and capabilities) with the sole exception of persistence.
                sessionStorage (as the name suggests) is only available for the duration of the browser session (and is
                deleted when the tab or window is closed) - it does, however, survive page reloads (source DOM Storage
                guide - Mozilla Developer Network).

                Clearly, if the data you are storing needs to be available on an ongoing basis then localStorage is
                preferable to sessionStorage - although you should note both can be cleared by the user so you should
                not rely on the continuing existence of data in either case.

                localStorage and sessionStorage are perfect for persisting non-sensitive data needed within client
                scripts between pages (for example: preferences, scores in games). The data stored in localStorage and
                sessionStorage can easily be read or changed from within the client/browser so should not be relied upon
                for storage of sensitive or security-related data within applications.

            <h2>Difference Between block scope, global scope </h2>
            <p>
                The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have
                global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
                function or conditional state can access that variable. <br>
                Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
                statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly
                brackets {}.
